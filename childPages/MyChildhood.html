  <h2 style="color: white;">My childhood has been unlike any other. I didn't grow up with the best health-care, technology, or even food.
   Nonetheless, when I was 7, I found out that I was moving to Canada. This meant that my whole life was about to change.
   I wouldn't say that I was necessarily happy to move, but I didnt have any other choice. 
   Growing up in Canada however wasn't as dificult as I thought it'd be. I learned to speak english quite fast and didnt have any problem talking to others.
   The only problem was that we werent living the best life here, as there was 7 people in one tiny apartment. 
   Soon after however, my parents found good jobs, and my siblings also help out as they've graduated now.</h2>

  <h2 style="color: white;">My childhood has been unlike any other. I didn't grow up with the best health-care, technology, or even food.
   Nonetheless, when I was 7, I found out that I was moving to Canada. This meant that my whole life was about to change.
   I wouldn't say that I was necessarily happy to move, but I didnt have any other choice.</h2>

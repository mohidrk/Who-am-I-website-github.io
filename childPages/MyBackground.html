  <h2 style="color: white;">My background is actually quite unique.
    If you were to ever look up my file, you'd notice that I share a different last name than my parents.
    This however has a deeper meaning. My grandpa grew up without much education, unknowing of the fact that your child's last name has to be your last name.
    This led to my grandpa giving my dad the last name of Razak. My dad on the other hand grew with more education than his father did, so he was aware of all customs in his society.
    So after I was born, his last and fifth child, he gave me the last name of Hussain, his father's last name, all for the reason to carry on his name. Me, out of all 5 children,
    was given the last name of Razak. </h2>
